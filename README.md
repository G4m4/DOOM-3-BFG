# Doom 3 BFG Edition GPL Source Code

This repo is a fork of https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3-BFG (see the [original README.txt](README_original.txt)).

## What

...another Doom3BFG fork.

As the original repo is getting older, I was dissatisfied with its antiquated build system on Windows - and the fact that other platforms clearly did not build out of the box. Other forks I could find are choked full of features (such as [RBDOOM3](https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/RBDOOM-3-BFG) and thus getting further away from the original.

Yet I believe as a medium size codebase it is well suited for all sorts of experiments, and that starting as close to the original as possible has some value.

So the goal here is twofold:
- keep a ` master` branch as close as possible to the original release, only adding what is required for building it easily, the modern way, on various platforms (Linux, MacOSX etc.)
- equip it with all sorts of diagnostics tooling in a `dev` trunk branch
- from `dev` fork branches to track various experiments (modernisation, optimisation and pretty much anything).

No "refactoring", "modernisation" of any kind happened, at least in the master branch.

### Build on master

#### Dependencies
Some dependencies are required as they were in the original build, the rendering backend:
- OpenGL on Linux (typically `libmesa-dev` but depends on your favorite flavour)
- DirectX on Windows, specifically the [June 2010 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812).

On Linux audio is implemented using FAudio as it is closest to the original XAudio2 implementation and thus you will need its dependency `SDL3`.

#### Building
The build system is based on `cmake`.
We make use of [Cmake presets](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) and a number of configuration and build presets are already in place for Windows, Linux and MacOSX.

So for instance a typical development preset on Windows is configured like this (and so on for other platforms):

`cmake --preset x64-windows-debug`

The executable is then built by invoking:

`cmake --preset x64-windows-debug --build . --target Doom3BFG`

## State of the master branch
As written above the master branch is kept as vanilla as possible.

### What changed on the master branch
- added a modern CMake-based build system
- some 32b specific quirks had to be replaced by more x64 standard ones
- on POSIX platforms, some Win32 based API calls had to be replaced by POSIX ones (specifically regarding threading and filesystem)
- on platforms other than Windows the sound implementation based on XAudio2 has been replaced by one based on [FAudio](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FAudio)
- a bunch of mandatory minor changes such as fixing includes file case

### What did *not* change on the master branch
- no use of "modern" C++: nothing was rewritten compared to the original, C++03-ish use
- no additional external dependencies but FAudio as stated above
- no attempt at cleaning, modernising or standardising in any way

## Other branches
Nothing yet

NOTE: unfortunately the README that came with our copy of the library has
been lost, so the one from release 6b is included instead. There are a few
'glue type' modifications to the library to make it easier to use from
the engine, but otherwise the dependency can be easily cleaned up to a
better release of the library.
